## Stairs and railings that combine safety with design

Stairways and railings are both functional and prominent features in any home. We construct and install stairs that meet strict code requirements while offering design options — from traditional wood to modern cable rail — that enhance your interior or exterior spaces.

### What we do

- Stair layout and structural framing
- Tread and riser installation (wood, tile, or stone)
- Handrail and baluster systems
- Deck and porch railing construction
- Repairs: tread replacement, railing reinforcement, code upgrades
- Custom designs: curved stairs, open risers, integrated lighting

### Why clients choose us

1. Precision carpentry — consistent rise and run for comfortable, safe stair use.
2. Code knowledge — we stay current on IRC and local amendments.
3. Clean installation — tight joints, secure fasteners, and professional finishes.

### Typical project phases

1. Site assessment and code review
2. Design and material selection
3. Framing and structural support
4. Tread, riser, and railing installation
5. Final inspection and client walkthrough

### Design considerations

- Verify stair dimensions: 7-7.75" rise, 10-11" run typical
- Handrail height: 34-38" above nosing
- Baluster spacing: maximum 4" gaps for safety
- Consider lighting: recessed tread lights or handrail illumination
### Example scope options

- Railing upgrade: replace outdated railings with code-compliant systems
- Tread replacement: refinish or replace worn stair treads and risers
- New stair construction: interior or exterior stairs with custom railings

We'll evaluate your existing stairs, discuss design preferences, and provide an estimate that includes materials and labor.
