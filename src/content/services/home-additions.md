## Expand your home with confidence

Home additions require careful planning and skilled execution. We manage the entire process — from feasibility and design through foundation, framing, systems integration, and finish work — ensuring your new space matches the quality and character of your existing home.

### What we do

- Feasibility studies and design collaboration
- Foundation and structural engineering coordination
- Framing, roofing, and exterior envelope
- Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC system extensions
- Insulation, drywall, and interior finishes
- Exterior siding and trim to match existing home

### Why clients choose us

1. Experience with complex tie-ins — matching roof lines, siding, and floor levels.
2. Proactive communication — regular updates and on-site coordination.
3. Clean project sites — respect for your property and daily living.

### Typical project phases

1. Initial consultation and conceptual design
2. Architectural drawings and engineering review
3. Permit processing and approvals
4. Foundation and framing construction
5. Systems rough-in and inspections
6. Interior and exterior finishes
7. Final walkthrough and warranty

### Design considerations

- Evaluate setbacks, easements, and lot coverage limits
- Plan roof lines and elevations for visual continuity
- Integrate HVAC and electrical with minimal disruption
- Choose materials that complement existing finishes

### Example scope options

- Bedroom and bath addition: single-story extension with new systems
- Second-story addition: master suite or additional bedrooms above existing structure
- Great room expansion: open-concept living and dining space

Every project begins with a site assessment. We'll review your goals, evaluate structural constraints, and develop a realistic budget and timeline.
