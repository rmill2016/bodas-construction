## A thoughtful, end-to-end kitchen remodel

We transform kitchens into functional, beautiful spaces that reflect how you live. Whether you're reconfiguring the layout for better flow, updating finishes, or doing a full structural remodel, our approach balances design intent with practical construction planning.

### What we do

- Design development and material selection
- Full demolition and selective structural work
- Custom and semi-custom cabinetry coordination
- Plumbing, electrical, HVAC modifications
- Tile, countertop, and finish installation
- Project management, scheduling, and on-site supervision

### Why clients choose us

1. Clear planning and fixed scopes — fewer surprises.
2. Local expertise — trusted subcontractors and timely permitting.
3. Quality-first execution — durable materials and tight details.

### Typical project phases

1. Initial consultation & site measure
2. Design package & estimate
3. Permits and material procurement
4. Construction & weekly check-ins
5. Final walkthrough & warranty handoff

### Design considerations

- Optimize workflow with the work triangle in mind
- Use durable finishes where daily use is highest
- Plan lighting in layers: ambient, task, and accent
- Incorporate storage solutions (pantries, pull-outs, deep drawers)

### Example scope options

- Quick refresh: cabinetry paint, new hardware, updated lighting
- Mid-range: new cabinets, appliances, countertops, flooring
- Full remodel: layout changes, structural work, new systems
