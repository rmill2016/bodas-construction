## Bathrooms designed for daily use and lasting value

A well-executed bathroom remodel improves both function and comfort. We approach each project with careful planning — addressing layout, ventilation, lighting, and waterproofing — while delivering finishes that hold up to daily use and moisture exposure.

### What we do

- Layout planning and fixture selection
- Demolition and plumbing rough-in
- Waterproofing systems and tile installation
- Vanity, mirror, and lighting installation
- Shower and tub surrounds (tile, acrylic, or stone)
- Ventilation, electrical, and final trim

### Why clients choose us

1. Code-compliant work — proper venting, GFCI outlets, and water-resistant materials.
2. Tile expertise — level surfaces, consistent grout lines, and long-lasting results.
3. Transparent pricing — fixture allowances and material selections documented upfront.

### Typical project phases

1. Design meeting and material selection
2. Permit and fixture ordering
3. Demolition and plumbing modifications
4. Waterproofing and substrate prep
5. Tile installation and grouting
6. Fixture installation and final details

### Design considerations

- Prioritize ventilation to manage moisture and prevent mold
- Use slip-resistant flooring in wet areas
- Plan for adequate lighting: vanity, shower, and ambient
- Consider accessible features: curbless showers, grab bars, comfort-height toilets

### Example scope options

- Cosmetic update: new fixtures, vanity, paint, and lighting
- Standard remodel: full tile surround, new tub/shower, vanity, and flooring
- Luxury upgrade: custom tile, frameless glass, high-end fixtures, and heated floors

We'll measure your space, discuss your needs, and provide a detailed estimate with fixture options and finishes.
