## Built for outdoor living and lasting performance

We design and build decks that expand your living space while standing up to Bay Area weather. From ground-level platforms to elevated multi-tier designs, our work emphasizes proper drainage, structural integrity, and thoughtful integration with your home's architecture.

### What we do

- Site assessment and design consultation
- Foundation and framing with engineered lumber
- Deck board installation (wood, composite, or PVC)
- Railing systems, stairs, and built-in benches
- Waterproofing, flashing, and ledger board attachment
- Renovation work: board replacement, structural reinforcement, refinishing

### Why clients choose us

1. Code-compliant construction — safe, inspected, and warrantied.
2. Material expertise — we help you choose the right product for your budget and maintenance preference.
3. Attention to detail — proper joist spacing, hidden fasteners, and clean finish work.

### Typical project phases

1. Site visit and design discussion
2. Material selection and detailed estimate
3. Permit submission and approval
